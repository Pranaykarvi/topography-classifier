    Welcome to the **Topography Classifier App**!  
    This application uses a Deep Learning model to classify satellite images into four categories:
    - **Sky/Cloud**
    - **Water**
    - **Desert**
    - **Forest**
    
    ### Problem Statement
    Satellites capture a vast amount of data, and classifying these images into meaningful categories is a challenge. 
    This app demonstrates how machine learning can address this problem efficiently.
    
    ### Approach
    The model uses a **custom ensemble of DenseNet, ResNet, and Xception architectures**, which are powerful for image classification tasks. 
    It was trained on satellite images to achieve high accuracy in topography classification.
    
    ### Techniques Used
    - Transfer Learning (DenseNet, ResNet, Xception)
    - Image Augmentation for better generalization
    - Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss and Adam Optimizer
    - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy and Loss

    - **Forest**
    
    Each image was resized to 224x224 pixels for training. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets to ensure reliable evaluation.
